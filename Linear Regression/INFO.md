# Linear Regression

Linear regression is the pure form of algorithm which correlates between two variables in the data set. The input and output sets examined to show a relationship. It also shows how the change in one variable can affect the other variable. It is represented by plotting a line on the graph. The algorithm is popular because it is easy to explain, transparent, and requires no tuning. Companies use this algorithm to forecast sales and risk assessment to take long term business decisions.
